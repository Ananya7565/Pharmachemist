# View
The below images will give you a glimpse of the application / site which a user will be exposed to. Most of the components, hover effects, transisitons and gradients have been implemented using plain css and javascript with html combining the two to make the webpages. Also certain features like navigation bars and alerts have been designed using Bootstrap 4. The user will be able to view products by category, add them to cart, review the prices, select the number of products they wish to order and also mimic a payment showing the completion of transaction. They will also be able to view their cart items and order history at any given moment.
